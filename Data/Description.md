##### Description:
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

From the data set in the (diabetes_raw.csv) file we can find several variables, some of them are independent (several medical predictor variables) and only one target dependent variable (Outcome).

##### Description:
The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a health-related telephone survey that is collected annually by the CDC. Each year, the survey collects responses from over 400,000 Americans on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of preventative services. It has been conducted every year since 1984. For this project, a csv of the dataset available on Kaggle for the year 2015 was used.

The dataset is a clean dataset of 253,680 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2015. The target variable Diabetes_012 has 3 classes. 0 is for no diabetes or only during pregnancy, 1 is for prediabetes, and 2 is for diabetes. There is class imbalance in this dataset. This dataset has 21 feature variables.
